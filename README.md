## Setup

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our node package manager, so before you start be sure to have it installed globally on your machine.
After that, you can clone the repository and on the root directory run


start the server

```
cd ./server
yarn
node index.js
```

start the client

```
yarn
yarn start
```
